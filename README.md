# aerekos-cloud

A local AWS-like cloud infrastructure platform that orchestrates distributed services across multiple worker devices using a conductor-worker architecture.

## Overview

aerekos-cloud provides a self-hosted, containerized cloud platform where:
- **Conductor** acts as the master orchestrator, managing all workers and services
- **Workers** are slave devices that host and run services
- **Services** are containerized applications that can be dynamically deployed across workers
- Everything runs locally using Docker and Docker Compose

## Architecture

### Components

#### Conductor
The conductor is the central control plane of aerekos-cloud:
- **Primary API**: Serves as the main API endpoint for all third-party applications
- **Worker Management**: Handles worker registration, discovery, and health monitoring
- **Service Orchestration**: Manages service lifecycle, deployment, and routing
- **Resource Management**: Tracks and allocates resources across workers
- **Frontend**: React Native dashboard for managing the entire infrastructure
- **Database**: Uses SQLite (via `aerekos-record`) to store all state

#### Workers
Workers are devices that host and run services:
- **Self-Registration**: Automatically register with conductor using token and IP
- **Resource Reporting**: Report available resources (CPU, RAM, disk, network)
- **Container Execution**: Run Docker containers as instructed by conductor
- **Heartbeat**: Maintain connection with conductor via periodic heartbeats
- **Resilience**: Automatically re-register after power outages or IP changes

#### Services
Services are the applications provided by aerekos-cloud:
- **Modular**: Each service lives in its own folder under `worker/`
- **Containerized**: Each service has its own `docker-compose.yml`
- **API-enabled**: Each service exposes its own API
- **Orchestrated**: Services communicate with conductor for coordination
- **Dynamic**: Can be enabled/disabled and deployed across workers on demand

### Data Flow

```
Third-Party Apps → Conductor API → Service APIs → Workers → Docker Containers
                                    ↓
                              SQLite Database
```

1. Third-party applications make requests to the Conductor API
2. Conductor routes requests to appropriate service APIs
3. Service APIs communicate with conductor for coordination
4. Conductor orchestrates deployment and manages workers
5. Workers execute Docker containers for services

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Network connectivity between conductor and workers

### Conductor Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd aerekos-cloud
   ```

2. **Set up conductor**
   ```bash
   cd conductor
   cp .env_example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start conductor**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Get registration token**
   ```bash
   # Token will be generated on startup and available via API
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/token
   ```

5. **Note conductor IP address**
   - Find the conductor's IP address on your network
   - This will be used by workers to register

### Worker Setup

1. **Configure worker**
   ```bash
   cd worker
   # Set environment variables
   export CONDUCTOR_TOKEN=<token-from-conductor>
   export CONDUCTOR_IP=<conductor-ip-address>
   ```

2. **Start worker**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify registration**
   - Check conductor dashboard or API to confirm worker registration
   - Worker will automatically report its resources

### Service Management

1. **List available services**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/services
   ```

2. **Enable a service**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/services/ai_manager/enable
   ```

3. **View service deployments**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/services/ai_manager/deployments
   ```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/workers/:id` - Get worker details
- `POST /api/workers/register` - Register a new worker
- `POST /api/workers/:id/heartbeat` - Worker heartbeat
- `GET /api/resources` - Get aggregated resource information

#### Service Management
- `GET /api/services` - List all services

- `POST /api/token/regenerate` - Generate new token (requires authentication)

### Service APIs

Each service exposes its own API endpoints. The conductor routes requests to services based on the service name and path.

#### Key Manager (KMS)
- `POST /api/key_manager/keys` - Create new encryption key
- `GET /api/key_manager/keys/:id` - Get key details
- `POST /api/key_manager/keys/:id/rotate` - Rotate key

#### Storage Manager (S3-like)
- `POST /api/storage_manager/buckets` - Create bucket
- `GET /api/storage_manager/buckets` - List buckets
- `DELETE /api/storage_manager/buckets/:name` - Delete bucket
- `POST /api/storage_manager/buckets/:name/objects` - Upload object
- `GET /api/storage_manager/buckets/:name/objects/:key` - Download object
- `DELETE /api/storage_manager/buckets/:name/objects/:key` - Delete object
- `GET /api/storage_manager/buckets/:name/objects` - List objects

#### Other Services
Example:
```
GET /api/ai_manager/models          → Routes to ai_manager service
GET /api/auth_manager/users         → Routes to auth_manager service
```

## Database Models

The conductor uses SQLite (via `aerekos-record`) with the following models:

- **User**: Stores user credentials (username, password_hash, email, role) - seeded only, no registration
- **Worker**: Stores worker device information
- **Service**: Stores service definitions and configuration
- **ServiceDeployment**: Tracks service deployments across workers
- **Token**: Manages conductor registration tokens
- **Resource**: Tracks worker resource availability

## Authentication

- **User Login**: `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate with username/password, returns JWT token
- **Current User**: `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current authenticated user (requires JWT)
- **No Registration**: Users are seeded only, no public registration endpoint
- **JWT Tokens**: All authenticated requests require JWT token in Authorization header
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage

## Coding Standards

### Backend Architecture

Follow a **service/repository pattern** with clear separation of concerns:

```
conductor/
├── services/          # Business logic layer
│   ├── UserService.js
│   ├── WorkerService.js
│   └── ServiceService.js
├── repos/             # Data access layer
│   ├── UserRepository.js
│   ├── WorkerRepository.js
│   └── ServiceRepository.js
├── routes/            # API routes (thin controllers)
│   ├── auth.js
│   ├── workers.js
│   └── services.js
├── middleware/        # Express middleware
│   ├── auth.js       # JWT authentication
│   └── errorHandler.js
└── utils/             # Utility functions
```

**Principles:**
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common functionality into services/utils
- **Separation of Concerns**: Routes handle HTTP, services handle business logic, repos handle data
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should do one thing well
- **Dependency Injection**: Services depend on repositories, not direct database access

**Example Service Structure:**
```javascript
// services/UserService.js
class UserService {
  constructor(userRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
  }
  
  async authenticate(username, password) {
    // Business logic here
  }
}

// repos/UserRepository.js
class UserRepository {
  async findByUsername(username) {
    // Database operations here
  }
}
```

### Frontend Architecture (React Native)

Organize code into clear, reusable modules:

```
screens/               # Screen components
components/            # Reusable UI components
├── Button/
│   ├── Button.jsx
│   └── Button.styles.js
├── Card/
│   ├── Card.jsx
│   └── Card.styles.js
hooks/                 # Custom React hooks
├── useAuth.js
├── useWorkers.js
└── useServices.js
styles/                # Global styles and themes
├── colors.js
├── typography.js
└── spacing.js
utils/                 # Utility functions
├── api.js            # API client
├── validation.js
└── helpers.js
```

**Principles:**
- **Component Separation**: Keep components small and focused
- **Style Separation**: Styles in separate files (`.styles.js` or `styles/` folder)
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract reusable logic into hooks
- **DRY**: Don't repeat component logic, extract to hooks/utils
- **Consistent Structure**: Follow the same folder structure across screens/components

**Example Component Structure:**
```javascript
// components/Button/Button.jsx
import { ButtonStyles } from './Button.styles';

export const Button = ({ title, onPress }) => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity style={ButtonStyles.container} onPress={onPress}>
      <Text style={ButtonStyles.text}>{title}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};

// components/Button/Button.styles.js
export const ButtonStyles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { ... },
  text: { ... }
});
```

### Environment Files

**Every service must have:**
- `.env` - Actual environment variables (gitignored)
- `.env_example` - Template with all required variables (committed)

**Example .env_example:**
```bash
PORT=3000
DATABASE_PATH=./data/conductor.db
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
CONDUCTOR_URL=http://conductor:3000
```

## Development

### Adding a New Service

1. **Create service folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p worker/my_service
   ```

2. **Create .env_example**
   ```bash
   PORT=3001
   CONDUCTOR_URL=http://conductor:3000
   DATABASE_PATH=./data/my_service.db
   ```

3. **Create docker-compose.yml**
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     my_service:
       image: my_service:latest
       ports:
         - "3001:3000"
       env_file:
         - .env
       environment:
         - CONDUCTOR_URL=http://conductor:3000
   ```

4. **Implement service API following standards**
   - Create `services/` folder for business logic
   - Create `repos/` folder for database operations
   - Create `routes/` folder for API endpoints
   - Keep code DRY, follow service/repo pattern
   - Service should register with conductor on startup
   - Expose API endpoints as needed
   - Report health status to conductor

5. **Add integration tests**
   - Test service endpoints
   - Test service-to-conductor communication
   - Test error handling

6. **Enable service**
   - Use conductor API or dashboard to enable the service
   - Conductor will deploy it to appropriate workers

### Local Development

1. **Start conductor in development mode**
   ```bash
   cd conductor
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start worker in development mode**
   ```bash
   cd worker
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Conductor
- `PORT` - API server port (default: 3000)
- `DATABASE_PATH` - SQLite database path (default: ./data/conductor.db)
- `TOKEN_SECRET` - Secret for token generation
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token signing
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` - JWT token expiration time (default: 24h)

#### Worker
- `CONDUCTOR_TOKEN` - Registration token from conductor
- `CONDUCTOR_IP` - IP address of conductor
- `CONDUCTOR_PORT` - Port of conductor API (default: 3000)
- `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` - Heartbeat interval in seconds (default: 30)

#### Services (key_manager, storage_manager, etc.)
- `PORT` - Service API port
- `CONDUCTOR_URL` - URL of conductor API
- `DATABASE_PATH` - SQLite database path for service
- Service-specific variables as needed

**Note**: Every service must have both `.env` and `.env_example` files. Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and fill in actual values.

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Not Registering
- Verify `CONDUCTOR_TOKEN` and `CONDUCTOR_IP` are set correctly
- Check network connectivity between worker and conductor
- Review conductor logs for registration errors

### Service Not Deploying
- Check worker resources are sufficient
- Verify service docker-compose.yml is valid
- Review conductor logs for deployment errors

### Database Issues
- Ensure SQLite database file has proper permissions
- Check database file path is correct
- Review database logs for errors

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test individual services and repositories
- Test utility functions and helpers
- Mock dependencies appropriately

### Integration Tests
